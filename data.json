But even within the Wizarding community, he is special. He is the boy who lived: the only person to have ever survived a killing curse inflicted by the evil Lord Voldemort, who launched a brutal takeover of the Wizarding world, only to vanish after failing to kill Harry.\r\n\r\nThough Harry's first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not everything is perfect.

He’s a killer for hire and the best in the business. But he’ll do the job only if the target is a truly bad guy. And now Billy wants out. But first there is one last hit. Billy is among the best snipers in the world, a decorated Iraq war vet, a Houdini when it comes to vanishing after the job is done. So what could possibly go wrong?\r\n\r\nI can't say I liked everything about Billy Summers, but I did find myself reaching for it whenever I had a spare minute, eager to know what was next for this rugged antihero with his closet full of trauma.\r\n\r\nSometimes King dives in with a creative (and often wacky) plot with lots of original touches (think It, Pet Sematary, Sleeping Beauties) but he's also a pro at taking on tired subjects and breathing new life into them. Here he takes a trope that is almost a subgenre in itself - that of the \"one last job\" spy/detective/assassin - acknowledges it in the text and invites us on his own exploration of it.\r\n\r\nThe writing and dialogue are strong, as I would expect from King at this point. Billy Summers is a hired killer set to retire and disappear into obscurity after he completes this one last job, but it's a job like no other. It requires him to play a role for a duration of weeks, or even months, and befriend his neighbours, before his target is in sight. His cover is that he is an author writing a book.\r\n\r\nI found Billy likeable, the kind of character who will do the morally questionable stuff to survive, and punish those who deserve it, but still stays quite firmly on the hero side of antihero, in my opinion. Alongside befriending his neighbours and beginning to feel shittier and shittier for deceiving them, Billy really does begin to write a book. His own story.\r\n\r\nWhat emerges is a tragic history, of course. I \"enjoyed\" reading about Billy as a child and adolescent, if enjoyed can be the word. The scenes in Fallujah were less gripping for me, simply because I've never had much interest in war stories.\r\n\r\nIt's a compelling plot with strong characters, especially the eponymous protagonist, and an overall quite touching message about what it is to be a writer, the freedom it offers, as well as the ability to shape worlds to your liking. The (sort of) romance felt weird for numerous reasons, even with Billy openly acknowledging them.\r\n\r\nHUGE warning for graphic depictions of violence, sexual assault, and post-assault trauma.", "created_date": "2022-08-31T12:00:00Z", "published_date": "2022-09-02T13:44:02.142Z"}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 4, "fields": {"author": 1, "title": "People We Meet on Vacation by Emily Henry", "text": "\"Poppy and Alex. Alex and Poppy. They have nothing in common. She’s a wild child; he wears khakis. She has insatiable wanderlust; he prefers to stay home with a book. And somehow, ever since a fateful car share home from college many years ago, they are the very best of friends. For most of the year they live far apart—she’s in New York City, and he’s in their small hometown—but every summer, for a decade, they have taken one glorious week of vacation together. Until two years ago, when they ruined everything. They haven’t spoken since...\"\r\n\r\nI think I want to give million hugs to author right now! I fell so hard for her latest book Beach Read which is still my favorite romance book of last year!\r\n\r\nI thought nothing she may write could be better than this lyrical/ dreamy/ feel good- tear jerker love story . But after reading this freaking heartbreaking amazing book I’m taking all back: this book is the best thing I’ve read for so long! And I can honestly say this is is going to be not this year’s best romance read for me but it also will take its space at my all time favorite and at least three times must read list! It’s freaking good!\r\n\r\nIt is unbelievably amazing mash up of When Harry Met Sally- Love, Rosie- One Day with combinations of 90’s best Meg Ryan romcoms vibes!\r\n\r\nThe couple’s first meeting and their road trip is truly inspired by When Harry Met Sally as the author mentioned at the end of the book but their 12 hilarious, inspirational, adventurous, exciting trips and the way of storytelling makes you gather the clues to find the missing matches to complete the puzzle to understand their 12 years long friendship zone relationship is outstandingly smart.\r\n\r\nPoppy and Alex were so so real, so powerful, so genuine! I feel like I have been knowing them for a long time. They’re polar opposites, wanting different things from life. As Poppy hates Linfield and khakis, those two things are Alex’s favorite things. As Poppy is vivid, energetic, hyperactive, adventurer, risk taker, Alex is more serene, picky, bookish, calm, controlling. Poppy never wants to settle down, desiring to experience different things from the life as Alex sticks to his routine, living at the same neighborhood, dreaming of being a happy family man.\r\n\r\nBut could wanting to different things from life stop them to yearn for each other?\r\n\r\nTwo years ago something happened in their Croatia trip. Now Poppy misses her friend like crazy, she’s not happy with her life and she cannot concentrate on her job! She decides to dodge a bullet, asking her best friend for one last trip to Palm Springs to fix their relationship. What could go wrong when you’re having an adventurous holiday with your favorite person?\r\nRight!???\r\n\r\nI don’t want to give any spoilers but I can only say one thing. There’s a part at the last third: Poppy gives a powerful and bold speech at the bar: the speech made me cried for at least three hours! My husband finally lost control and put duct tapes to my mouth to make me shut up. I think I’m also suffering from dried eye syndrome. I may have dropped at least five gallons of tears and I think I’m out of tears for a long time! But that emotional speech and entire book made my entire year!\r\n\r\nI LOVED IT SO MUCH! I LOVED IT SO MUCH! I LOVED IT SO MUCH! I LOVED IT SO MUCH! I LOVED IT SO MUCH!\r\n\r\nOkay, I’m stopping right now!
